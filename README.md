# ProjectPilot AI 🚀

## Project Overview
ProjectPilot AI is an advanced, AI-powered project management and developer productivity platform built with Next.js. It helps developers plan, track, and execute their projects efficiently while providing a personalized career roadmap and smart AI mentoring.
